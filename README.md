## Linear Regression To Predict MPG:

• Ground Clearance, Intercept, And Vehicle Length Provide A Non-Random Amount Of Variance To The MPG Values In The Dataset. 

• The Slope Of The Linear Model Is Not Considered To Be Zero Because The Multi Linear Model Is: MPG = 6.27 * vehicle_length + 1.25e-3 * vehicle_weight + 6.88e-2 * spoiler_angle -3.41 * AWD + 3.55 * ground_clearance - 1.04e+2. 

• The Multi Linear Model Does Predict MPG Of MechaCar Prototypes Effectively Since The Value Of R-Square Is 0.71 (Which Means That 71% Of Variations Pertaining To MPG Can Be Indicated By Changes In The Vehicle Length, The Vehicle Weight, The Spoiler Angle, The Drivetrain, And The Ground Clearance).

• The Current Manufacturing Data Does Not Meet The Design Specification For All Manufacturing Lots In Total And Each Lot Individually. Lot 1 And Lot 2 Meet The Design Specifications. Lot 3 Displays The Greatest Variance And It Exceeds The Design Specifications.

 ## Study Design: MechaCar Vs Competition:
 
 
 • Additional Metrics That Might Interest Consumers Can Possibly Include: Cost, Car Color, City Fuel Efficiency, Highway Fuel Efficiency, Horsepower, Maintenance Costs, And Safety Ratings.
 
 • The Metrics I Will Test Are: Safety Ratings, Horsepower, And Highway Fuel Efficiency.
 
 • I Will Be Using A Multiple Linear Regression Statistical Summary To Test My Hypothesis Because That Type Of Statistical Test Will Display How Highway Fuel Efficiency And Horsepower Affect Safety Ratings. 
 
 • A Random Sample Containing Numerous Values Will Be Needed In Order To Run My Statistical Test.
